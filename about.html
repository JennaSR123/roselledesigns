<h1>About Me</h1>

<p><img src="images/jenna2.jpg" alt="Jenna at the Temple of Peace" style="width:30%;float:right;margin-left:25px;" />Hi, I'm Jenna. I'm a web designer/developer and photographer based in New England. I like hibiscus flowers and the color red. I don't talk much, especially not about myself, but here's a photo coutesy of my friend Eli. (They're the winged model on the homepage.) This is the Temple of Peace at the Tower Hill Botanical Garden.</p>
<h1>Okay, but why hire me?</h1>
<p>I might look young, but I've got five years of experience working with clients and a decade of education. I've been on the web for about two-thirds of its lifespan, watching standards update and styles evolve. I was around for the rise of smartphones and the death of Flash, and if I find a web page that's older than 2007, I will get excited and treat it like a little piece of history; the older, the better. </p>
<p>Need some credentials? On top of a degree in Multimedia Communications from Blackstone Valley Tech, I graduated from Massachusetts Bay Community College with an AS in Computer Information Systems, a certificate in Web Design, and a certificate in Cyber Security. On top of that, I'm still earning my BS in Information Technology at UMass Lowell, one course at a time. </p>
<!--<p>I have more skills than just what I found in education, though. Though my degrees taught me the basics of coding a website, I doubled down on JavaScript with a bootcamp and got familiar with BootStrap again. Next on the list is learning Node, React, SASS and LESS.</p>-->
<p>I want to be a full stack developer in the future, despite being primarily front-end at the moment. I'll never stop working towards this goal for as long as the Web exists, so you can count on me to seek out education and keep up with the advancement of technology.</p>
<p>Right now, I can confidently write HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript, BootStrap, PHP, SQL, and a bit of Java and Python. My sights are set to learn Node, React, jQuery, SASS and LESS next.</p>
<h1>Why hibiscus?</h1>
<p>Oh, now <em>flowers</em>, I can talk about all day. I do a bit of gardening in my spare time. Bear with me here. Besides the tropicals, I've got two hardy hibiscus, a Holy Grail and a Midnight Marvel. They boast deep burgundy blooms nearly the size of a dinner plate, and lovely purple foliage behind them. </p>
<p>These beauties are my namesake. Hardy hibiscus are sturdy, dependable plants from root to flower. They start out as unassuming green shoots in the spring, only to grow at incredible speeds, and wow with changing colors and show-stopping blossoms later on. They also wilt dramatically if you don't water them every day, but they're perfectly fine. It's clear to see why I relate to them so much. </p>
<p>My hardy hibiscus inspired the design of this website, from the colors to the name. (A roselle is a type of hibiscus, not a rose, and is used in hibiscus tea.)</p>
